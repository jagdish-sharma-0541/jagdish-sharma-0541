I am J P Sharma, a senior citizen, and interested to use my time creatively,
by using technology - have decided to pick up web development as a hobby and also
as a subject of teaching to youngsters (free).

There is so much stuff on the net to confuse any one.  I would like to introduce
an element of simplicity in learning without adding to the material already in loads on the net.

my email is jps0541@gmail.com.  It will take some time when I am able to reach a 
stage where I can impart the useful knowledge without waiste of time by the 
learner.

J P Sharma
